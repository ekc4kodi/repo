Nothing Yet
Thank you everyone for your continues support. NFL streams have been placed under the sports section and they seem to be very good streams. anything that is acestream see,s to be the best. you do need to install acestream first though. To do this click down from maintenance and select acestream and follow all the prompts. Once it is installed and opened to the sign in screen, there is no sign in. Back click back into Kodi and all of the ace links will work. Enjoy :-)
