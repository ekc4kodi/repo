   <title>EKC SILVER 35.4 HAS BEEN RELEASED 9-24-19. I HAVE CHANGED THE DEFAULT TO THE SCRUBS FOR MOVIES AND GREASED LIGHTNING FOR SHOWS. NFL SECTIONS HAVE BEEN ADDED AS WELL. THE SELECTOR CAN STILL BE USED ANYWHERE HOWEVER, AS I KNOW IT WAS VERY POPULAR WITH A LOT OF YOU. SIMPLY PRESS AND HOLD SELECT ON ANY MEDIA ANYWHERE AND SELECT OPENMETA CHOOSE PLAYER. INSIDE THESE OPTIONS IVE ALSO ADDED THE CREW AS A 5TH OPTION. IT IS A VERY GOOD ONE AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</title>
