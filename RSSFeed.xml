   <title>AFTER MANY HOURS OF WORK, EKC 27 IS NOW RELEASED ON KODI 18. THE BUILD IS NO LONGER COMPATABLE WITH KODI 17 VERSIONS. IF YOU ARE STILL ON A 17 KODI PLEASE UPDATE EKC THAN WHEN YOU GET THE BLUE SCREEN, HIGHTLIGHT ADDONS CLICK TO THE RIGHT AND FIND EKC WIZARD. ONCE INSIDE THE WIZARD CLICK APK INSTALLER THAN KODI. AFTER THE INSTALL YOULL BE GOOD. MANY NEW THINGS IN THIS VERSION AS I BUILT IT BACK UP FROM SCRATCH. CHANNEL LINE UP ABOVE LIVE TV IS SOLID. I CAN ALSO ADD CHANNELS FOR YOU IF YOU REQUEST THEM ON MY PAGE AT FACEBOOK.COM/ELITEKUSTOMCONFIG - IF CHANNELS GO DOWN PLEASE REPORT THEM THERE AS WELL SO I CAN REPAIR THEM. MOVIES AND SHOWS ARE SET TO GAIA. IT WORKS VERY WELL BUT IS SLOW. PLEASE BE PATIENT AND DONT CLICK LIKE CRAZY. BACKUPS IN THE SUB MENU ARE FASTER BUT NOT AS RELIABLE MOST OF THE TIME.</title>
