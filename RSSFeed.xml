   <title>A SOFT UPDATE WAS JUST PUSHED TO FIX THE BACKUPS FOR TV SHOWS AND MOVIES. TO GET A SOFT UPDATE, YOU WILL NOT RECIEVE A PROMPT, SO YOU NEED TO GO UNDER SYSTEM AND CLICK EKC UPDATE. ON EKC 33, I SWITCHED DEFAULT FOR MOVIES AND SHOWS TO GAIA. IT WORKS VERY WELL BUT I DID NOTICE THAT IF IT SAYS NO STREAMS AVAILABLE,  YOU CAN FIX THIS BY EXITING EKC SILVER AND GOING BACK INTO IT.BACKGROUNDS HAVE ALL BEEN CHANGED AS WELL. WE HAVE MANY BACKUP OPTIONS IN THE SUB MENU OF MOVIES AND TV SHOWS JUST IN CASE YOU NEED THEM.</title>
