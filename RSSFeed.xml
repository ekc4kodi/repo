   <title>I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A NEW STREAMING SYSTEM CALLED ELEMENTUM. IT HAS MADE THINGS VERY BUGGY AND IM STILL FINDING WAYS TO MAKE IT WORK. THIS IS THE REASON FOR ALL THE ERRORS WITHIN EKC RECENTLY. ONCE I GET IT ALL TWEAKED THE WAY I WANT SO IT RUNS SMOOTHLY IM GOING TO RELEASE WITH EKC 29. I ALSO HAVE FOUND A GREAT SOURCE FOR FREE LIVE TV IN HD. STILL WORKING ON THE FINISHING TOUCHES BUT EVERYTHING WILL RUN VERY WELL WHEN IM DONE. ELEMENTUM PLAYS IN 1080P MOST OF THE TIME WITH NO BUFFERING AT ALL. EXCITING STUFF..</title>
